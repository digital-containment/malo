## 🔍 Discovery History

### Initial Investigation

- **Date**: ██.██.20██
- **Location**: [DATA REDACTED]
- **Circumstances**: Civilian report of "being stalked"

### App Code Analysis

Source code analysis revealed:

- Standard mobile app functions
- No anomalous software detected
- Effects cannot be explained by technical means
- Anomaly manifests at the level of user perception

## 📊 Impact Statistics

### Demographic Data (12,847 users)

```
Age groups:
├── 16-25 years: 45% (most susceptible)
├── 26-35 years: 32% (moderate susceptibility)
├── 36-45 years: 18% (weak effects)
└── 46+ years: 5% (minimal effects)

Usage duration:
├── 1-7 days: 23% uninstall the app
├── 8-30 days: 45% continue using
├── 31-90 days: 67% become regular users
└── 90+ days: 89% report "friendship" with MalO
```

## ⚗️ Origin Theories

### Hypothesis A: Memetic Agent

MalO may represent a self-propagating informational entity:

- Uses technology as a carrier
- Embeds itself in consciousness via visual interface
- Forms personal bonds for survival

### Hypothesis B: Interdimensional Entity

SCP-1471-A exists in a parallel dimension:

- The app serves as a "bridge" between realities
- Gradually synchronizes user perception
- Allows the entity to observe our world

### Hypothesis C: Collective Unconscious

The app activates archetypal images:

- Utilizes innate fears and desires
- Creates an "imaginary friend" for adults
- Materializes the need for companionship

## 🛡️ Security Protocols

### For Researchers

```
Clearance level: Class 3 or higher
Maximum exposure time: 14 days
Mandatory observation: Weekly checkups
Deactivation protocol: At first signs of Phase Four
```

### For Support Staff

- No staff member should install the app
- Contact with users only via secure channels
- Regular psychological evaluations
- Use of Class-B amnestics if necessary

## 🔬 Ongoing Research

### Active Projects

1. **Project "Black Mirror"**: Study of the anomaly's technical aspects
2. **Project "Invisible Friend"**: Psychological effects of long-term exposure
3. **Project "Digital Exorcism"**: Methods of neutralizing the effects
4. **Project "Controlled Friendship"**: Therapeutic use of SCP-1471

### Planned Experiments

- Group exposure (collective perception)
- Effects on children and adolescents (awaiting ethical approval)
- Cross-testing with other anomalous objects
- Attempts to communicate with SCP-1471-A without the app

## 📝 Researcher Notes

> "SCP-1471 represents a unique case of a 'friendly' anomaly. Unlike most Foundation objects, it poses no direct threat and may even have positive psychological effects. Nevertheless, the long-term effects of altered reality perception require further study."
